Get Epic Shit done


Think of it this way: there is no one, absolutely no one on planet Earth who has the same characteristics as you do. Your temperament, your capability, your choices, where you were born, your family, your upbringing, your luck – all are so unique to you that by design no one can be like you.
Since everyone started off differently, everyone by default will end up differently.

Teacher: The emotions that we humans go through are not permanent. What we feel today, we will not feel tomorrow. However, what we feel today can either make us depressed or induce us to take action.

You need to understand that you cannot eliminate the risk. You can only understand it.

And, if I can’t trust you, it doesn’t matter how smart you are.
trust is that even when things go wrong, you know that everything that was needed to be done to prevent it was done and everything needed to fix it will be done.
Building trust is a function of three things: 
One, to be there for people when times are difficult.
To be there for your friend when they are not at their best. 
To be there for your manager when everyone else in the team is moving on.
To be there for your loved ones when they are not in a place of giving love but are needing it.

In a rapidly changing world, the ability to become a student whenever you have to is a superpower!


Let’s say you want to reach out to someone who works in a company that apparently pays their employees lavishly, and you want to work in that or a similar company. So you reach out to them, stating:
Hey XXX,
I really appreciate the work you have been doing at XYZ company. The company’s achievements and how your career has grown are wonderful testaments to that.
XXX, I am planning to switch my job from ABC company to XYZ company and want your help in understanding the upsides as well as the downsides of working in a company like this, in general.
Would you be willing to help me here? I have 3 specific questions to ask, and I won’t take more than 10 minutes of your time. And we can do it over email itself, or if you prefer a call.
PS: Here you write something that is unique to them (through their content) and comment on how it is so unique. This is to have their attention and get them to say a yes.





So what I understand is that at all points of time in my life I need to be self-aware of the one thing that I need from my career the most. That thing can change, but at that moment if I don’t attend to it, I will constantly feel underserved.


Remember, no one expects you to hit a 6 on the first ball of the match. However, everyone does expect you to be capable of doing that when the moment arises.

You must understand that while times have changed, our parents haven’t. So we must balance our love and empathy for them with educating them about our life and the choices we make.
The beautiful thing about forgiveness is that the moment you seek it, you create a safe space for the other person to also ask for it.

It starts with understanding that it is going to be a difficult conversation. Because when you are setting boundaries with people you love – could be friends, partners, parents – you are essentially saying that here is where my space starts and your space ends.
Teacher: We know ourselves through our thoughts. Others know us through our actions. If our actions (in this case, conversations) do not speak up for what we want, all we are saying is that we do not want anything.

Difficult situations do not test us. They reveal us.

What isn’t your fault is still your responsibility. Just because you didn’t create the problem doesn’t mean you don’t solve the problem.

Planning is easy. Execution requires discipline.
